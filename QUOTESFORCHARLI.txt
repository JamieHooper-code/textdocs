When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up."eating a very dramatic like a work from home and found

Albert Camus (to René Char) // "The older I get, the more I find that you can only live with beings who liberate you, and who love you with an affection that is as light to bear as it is strong to feel… This is how I am your friend, I love your happiness, your freedom, your adventure…and I would like to be for you the companion you are sure of, always."

You, of course, are not I, and it must be from someplace in you, not me, that you serve. only remember what is plainly and always true. The act of serving fulfills itself. - Tamar Adler

Alienation is not simply the absence of legal ownership of the means and fruits of production — it is the lack of control over one’s relationship with the world.

"I have led a toothless life", he thought. " A toothless life.I have never bitten into anything.I was waiting.I was reserving myself for later on-and I have just noticed that my teeth have gone." John Paul Sartre

Covered with ashes, tearing my hair, my face scored by clawing, but with piercing eyes, I stand before all humanity recapitulating my shames without losing sight of the effect I am producing, and saying: “I was the lowest of the low.” Then imperceptibly I pass from the “I” to the “we.” When I get to “This is what we are,” the trick has been played and I can tell them off. I am like them, to be sure; we are in the soup together. However, I have a superiority in that I know it and this gives me the right to speak. You see the advantage, I am sure.

Nevertheless, I find them more moral than the others, those who kill in the bosom of the family by attrition. Haven’t you noticed that our society is organized for this kind of liquidation? You have heard, of course, of those tiny fish in the rivers of Brazil that attack the unwary swimmer by thousands and with swift little nibbles clean him up in a few minutes, leaving only an immaculate skeleton? Well, that’s what their organization is. “Do you want a good clean life? Like everybody else?” You say yes, of course. How can one say no? “O.K. You’ll be cleaned up. Here’s a job, a family, and organized leisure activities.” And the little teeth attack the flesh, right down to the bone.
