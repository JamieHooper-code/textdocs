Yap about whatever book(s) you’ve been reading over a warm cup of tea 🫖  Even if you haven't been reading lately, come listen and join in on the discussion.
We'll brew a communal tea pot, and you're welcome to bring some tea or anything else if you'd like 💕

The book club is a like decentralized book club where everyone just reads whatever they want and We get together twice a month and yap about whatever we are reading and drink tea :)) it's every other Thursday and the location changes, 7 PM. If you use Google calendar I can add you to the recurring invite if you're interested, I would just need your email
