EATING:
	THE FIRST CONTEMPLATION 
		This food is a gift of the whole universe, the earth, the sky, and much mindful work.   

	THE SECOND CONTEMPLATION :
		May we eat in mindfulness so as to be worthy of it.   
		
	THE THIRD CONTEMPLATION:
		May we transform our unskillful states of mind and learn to eat in moderation.   
		
	THE FOURTH CONTEMPLATION :
		May we take only foods that nourish us and prevent illness.   
		
	THE FIFTH CONTEMPLATION :
		May we accept this food to realize the path of understanding and love.

	Practice:
		Work together for five or 10 minutes, setting the table and finishing whatever needs to be done
		
		When the food is on the table and everyone is seated, practice breathing:
		" Breathing in, I calm my body . Breathing out, I smile " three times
		
		breathe in and out and look at each person at the table and smile
		
		After reading and smiling, look down at the food in a way that allows the food to become real. This food reveals your connection with the earth. Each bite contains the life of the sun and the earth.
		
		Upon finishing your meal, take a few moments to notice that you have finished, your goal is not emptying your hunger satisfied. Take a moment to be grateful that you have had this nourishing food to eat, supporting you on the path of love and understanding.
		
		The meal is finished, my hunger satisfied,
		I vow to live for the benefit of all beings.
