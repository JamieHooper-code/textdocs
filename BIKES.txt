bikes and more (NEAR WARDS)
Goodbike (near C&G)


Best companies for cheaper bikes are: 
	Giant
	Specialized
	Trek
	Cannondale
	Marin
	Diamondback
	Raleigh
	Kona
	Felt
	Jamis
	Fuji
	Scott
	GT
	Norco

Try to stay away from:
	Mongoose
	Schwinn
	Huffy
	Roadmaster
	Hyper
	etc.

-27.5" or 29" wheels are better than 26"***. You can find more parts available including rims, tyres, tubes, etc.***

-When buying hybrid or mountain bikes with suspension forks, actively look for forks with a manual lock-out lever on the top of the stanchion. This allows the fork to act as a rigid fork during usage on pavement or trails where suspension is not typically needed.
