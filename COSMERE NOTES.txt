		present as the 12 moons and 12 spores in tress and the Emerald sea. 
		Present in Mistborn book 7 x 1 of the ghost bloods with crystal growing powers.

	DawnShards:
		shards of immense power, I don't really understand what they do or where they come from but they are immensely powerful and important and need to be kept safe from certain people
		apparently they were some sort of primordial weapon used to kill adonalsium
		Sigzil has one. Given to him by wit. At the end of wind and truth. he is the character nomad in the sunlit man.
		Rysn has the other one. From the novel DawnShard
			
	Dor:
		some sort of liquid investiture that people keep in jars. Appears in Mistborn seven and in the sunlit man
