I have had ongoing struggles gender dysphoria for several years and I am very interested in doing a consultation to find a therapist that specializes in this as well as discussing the possibility of hormone replacement therapy.


I live in Florida and  need a doctor to sign that consent form thing

I am looking for a medical doctor in Gainesville that can sign the Florida consent form thing in person. I would love some recommendations, I'm not going to start my subscription until I get that because who knows how long that will take. I have contacted Planned Parenthood  and the UF health and neither are taking on new clients.
