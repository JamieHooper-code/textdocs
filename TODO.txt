**Hey guys, my therapist suggested that I ask people to write little notes or letters about what you guys like about me and/or why we're friends (since the answers may shock me! :0) 

They can be as short or long as you want, physical or digital, here or a dm, and obviously don't have to be immediate. Just interested to see why you people engage w me /hj. 

Thanks in advance if you participate.
