# Windows 11 Fresh Install — Setup Guide
> Organized by priority: get accessible first, then everything else.
> Items marked [Claude can help] are ones I can assist with directly.

---

## PHASE 0 — DO BEFORE YOU WIPE (critical)

These have no backups. Export/document settings now or they're gone.

- [x] **Display Fusion** — backup exported 2026-03-26 as `Backups from old PC/DisplayFusion Backup (2026-03-26).reg` in `desktop-important` (registry export, restore by double-clicking)
- [x] **PowerToys / FancyZones** — settings backed up 2026-03-26 to `Backups from old PC/PowerToys/` in `desktop-important` (FancyZones layouts, hotkeys, all module settings)
- [ ] **VS Code** — Settings Sync is tied to your Microsoft/GitHub account; verify it's enabled (Settings > Turn on Settings Sync) so extensions and config restore automatically

Verify GitHub/OneDrive has latest versions of:
- [ ] Caster rules (rules/ folder) — push any uncommitted changes
- [ ] AutoHotkey files
- [ ] Startup program
- [ ] Stream Deck profiles (already in GitHub per notes)

---

## PHASE 1 — First Hour: Get Input Working

Goal: Be able to control the computer without constant pain.

### 1.1 Windows + Microsoft Account
- [ ] Install Windows 11
- [ ] Sign in to Microsoft account → OneDrive starts syncing in background
- [ ] Let OneDrive sync before doing anything that depends on it

### 1.2 Chrome + Google Account
- [ ] Install Chrome
- [ ] Sign in to Google account → bookmarks, extensions restore automatically
- [ ] **Vimium** should restore from Chrome sync; verify it loaded
- [ ] Confirm Vimium keybinds are correct (they sync with Google account)

### 1.3 Dragon NaturallySpeaking
- [ ] Install Dragon NaturallySpeaking 15
- [ ] Restore profile from OneDrive (should be at known path in OneDrive)
- [ ] Run through Dragon's microphone check
- [ ] Test basic dictation before moving on

### 1.4 Claude
- [ ] Open claude.ai in Chrome — usable immediately, no install needed
- [ ] Install Claude Code extension in VS Code once VS Code is up (Phase 4)

### 1.5 AutoHotkey
- [ ] Install AutoHotkey (needed for Caster to function fully)
- [ ] Clone or pull AHK repo from GitHub (or let OneDrive restore it)
- [ ] Do NOT start MAINFUNCTIONS.ahk yet — wait until Caster is set up

---

## PHASE 2 — Voice Commands: Caster + Stream Deck

Goal: Full voice command stack working so setup of everything else is faster.

### 2.1 Python + Caster Dependencies
- [ ] Install Python (check which version Caster requires — likely 3.x)
- [ ] Install Caster and dragonfly2 via pip
- [ ] Restore both Caster folders from OneDrive/GitHub:
  - AppData Caster folder (user data/settings)
  - Rules folder (the GitHub repo at `c:\Users\Nate\AppData\Local\caster\rules`)
- [ ] Verify `settings/rules.toml` has all rules listed in `_enabled_ordered`

### 2.2 Startup Program
- [ ] Pull startup program from OneDrive/GitHub
- [ ] Run it — this should start Dragon, Caster, AHK, and other components together
- [ ] Test a few voice commands to confirm Caster + AHK bridge is working
  - [Claude can help] Debug any rule or AHK wiring issues

### 2.3 Stream Deck
- [ ] Install Elgato Stream Deck software
- [ ] **Quit Stream Deck before restoring profiles**
- [ ] Pull Stream Deck profiles from GitHub
- [ ] Copy profiles to `%APPDATA%\Elgato\StreamDeck\ProfilesV3\`
- [ ] Open Stream Deck — it reads from disk on startup
- [ ] Verify buttons on both Deck A and Deck B
  - [Claude can help] Add or fix any buttons programmatically

---

## PHASE 3 — Display & Window Management

Goal: Screen layout and virtual desktops working.

- [ ] **Display Fusion** — install, import settings from Phase 0 backup

    6Y2Dl7Ndc7M1Djo8l7znOexDCgbyVR_FtwTmKFzc_DUNXb6SnaCFeRVjxcrA=
    ```
  - Settings backup: `Backups from old PC/DisplayFusion Backup (2026-03-26).reg` in `desktop-important`
  - Configure monitor layout, taskbars, hotkeys
- [ ] **Microsoft PowerToys / FancyZones** — install from Microsoft Store or GitHub
  - Restore settings: copy contents of `Backups from old PC/PowerToys/` from `desktop-important` to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\PowerToys\`
  - FancyZones layouts, hotkeys, and all module settings will be restored
- [ ] **Windows Virtual Desktop Enhancer** — pull from OneDrive/GitHub and install
  - Verify virtual desktop hotkeys work with AHK

---

## PHASE 4 — Development Tools

- [ ] **VS Code**
  - Install, sign in to sync account → extensions/settings restore automatically
  - Verify Claude Code extension is installed
  - [Claude can help] Any workspace/settings config
- [ ] **Notepad++** — pull config from GitHub, install plugins if needed
- [ ] **Claude** (claude.ai) — already accessible via Chrome; Claude Code via VS Code

---

## PHASE 5 — Remaining Apps (order doesn't matter much)

These don't affect accessibility, install as needed:

- [ ] **Anki** — log in to AnkiWeb account, decks sync from cloud
- [ ] **Calibre** — install, point library at wherever books are stored
- [ ] **Python** — install before qBittorrent search will work (qBittorrent may prompt for this)
- [ ] **Jackett** — install and run; it powers the jackett search engine in qBittorrent
  - After install, open Jackett (localhost:9117), copy the API key
  - Paste it into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\qBittorrent\nova3\engines\jackett.json` under `"api_key"` (the copy in `Backups from old PC` has a placeholder — update it after Jackett install)
- [ ] **qBittorrent** — install, then restore search plugins:
  - Copy `Backups from old PC/qBittorrent_nova3` folder from `desktop-important` to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\qBittorrent\nova3`
  - Rutracker will re-authenticate automatically on first search (credentials saved in `rutracker.json`)
  - All other engines (piratebay, solidtorrents, limetorrents, etc.) work immediately
- [ ] **VoiceMeeter** — install, then copy `Backups from old PC/VoiceMeeterDefault.xml` from `desktop-important` to `%APPDATA%\VoiceMeeterDefault.xml`
- [ ] **OpenRGB** — install, then copy `Backups from old PC/OpenRGB.json` from `desktop-important` to `%APPDATA%\OpenRGB\OpenRGB.json`
- [ ] **Audacity** — install, then restore settings from `Backups from old PC/Audacity/` in `desktop-important`:
  - Copy `audacity.cfg`, `pluginsettings.cfg`, `pluginregistry.cfg` to `%APPDATA%\audacity\`
- [ ] **f.lux** — install, sign in to account (settings sync via account)
- [ ] **Greenshot** — install, then copy `Backups from old PC/Greenshot.ini` from `desktop-important` to `%APPDATA%\Greenshot\Greenshot.ini` (restores hotkeys and capture settings)
- [ ] **KeyTik** — install, then copy `Backups from old PC/KeyTik/` from `desktop-important` to `%APPDATA%\KeyTik\` (restores pinned AHK profiles)
- [ ] **Everything** (voidtools) — install, indexing runs automatically
- [ ] **Signal** — install, link as linked device or restore from backup
- [ ] **Kindle** — install, log in to Amazon account

---

## PHASE 6 — Optional

Install if/when needed.

- [ ] **SoundSwitch** — install, copy `Backups from old PC/SoundSwitchConfiguration.json` from `desktop-important` to `%APPDATA%\SoundSwitch\SoundSwitchConfiguration.json`
- [ ] **Tobii** — install drivers + software (hardware dependency)
- [ ] **eViacam** — install and reconfigure (no backup; settings were not exported)
- [ ] **PrecisionGazeMouse** — install and reconfigure (no backup; settings were not exported)

## Notes for Claude

- This system uses Dragon NaturallySpeaking 15 + Caster/dragonfly2
- AHK is called via `MAINFUN.bat` → `MAINFUNCTIONS.ahk` which `#Include`s helper files
- Caster rules are at `c:\Users\Nate\AppData\Local\caster\rules\`
- Stream Deck profiles are in GitHub; edits go to ProfilesV3 (not V2)
- User goes by Jamie; file paths use Nate (legacy)
- Default to Deck A for Stream Deck operations unless Deck B is specified
- Complex voice command logic belongs in AHK, not Caster Python files

---

## Git Repositories — Backup Inventory

All repos are under `JamieHooper-code` on GitHub. Two repos use SSH (`git@github.com`) — SSH keys must be set up on the new machine before those can be cloned.

| Repo | GitHub URL | Clone path on new machine | Protocol |
|---|---|---|---|
| user-caster (rules + settings) | github.com/JamieHooper-code/user-caster | `C:\Users\Nate\AppData\Local\caster` | SSH |
| streamdeck-backup | github.com/JamieHooper-code/streamdeck-backup | `%APPDATA%\Elgato\StreamDeck` | HTTPS |
| sublime-backup | github.com/JamieHooper-code/sublime-backup | `%APPDATA%\Sublime Text\Packages\User` | SSH |
| autohotkey | github.com/JamieHooper-code/autohotkey | `C:\Users\Nate\Desktop\Important\AutoHotkey` | HTTPS |
| textdocs | github.com/JamieHooper-code/textdocs | `C:\Users\Nate\Desktop\Important\TEXTDOCS` | HTTPS |
| chrome-newtab | github.com/JamieHooper-code/new-tab | `C:\Users\Nate\Desktop\Important\chrome-newtab` | HTTPS |
| caster-main | github.com/JamieHooper-code/caster-main | `C:\Users\Nate\Documents\Caster` | SSH |
| claude-config-backup | github.com/JamieHooper-code/claude-config-backup | `C:\Users\Nate\.claude` | HTTPS |
| desktop-important | github.com/JamieHooper-code/desktop-important | `C:\Users\Nate\Desktop\Important` | HTTPS |

### Uncommitted changes — push before wiping
- **user-caster** — `rules/.claude/settings.local.json` (local settings file, low priority)
- **textdocs** — this guide and other untracked files should be committed before wiping

### SSH setup on new machine
Before cloning the SSH repos (user-caster, sublime-backup, caster-main):
1. Generate a new SSH key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email"`
2. Add public key to GitHub → Settings → SSH Keys
3. Then clone normally

### Notes
- `Desktop/Important` → `github.com/JamieHooper-code/desktop-important` (HTTPS) — excludes AutoHotkey/, TEXTDOCS/, chrome-newtab/, BOOKS/, Bitwig installers
- [Claude can help] Run the pushes for any of the uncommitted repos above

## Username Change: Nate → Jamie

The new Windows 11 install will use `Jamie` as the username instead of `Nate`. This affects any path starting with `C:\Users\Nate\`.

### Already fixed (dynamic — will just work)
All Python/Caster rule files now use `os.environ` at load time:
- `windows_commands.py` — all BringApp paths and Choice directory/edit_location dicts
- `chrome_commands.py` — SAVE_THE_LISTS path
- `command_line_commands.py` — OneDrive symlink command
- `reading_commands.py` — user path

### Needs manual attention on the new machine

**Claude memory folder path**
The memory folder is stored at a path derived from the project directory name:
`~\.claude\projects\c--Users-Nate-AppData-Local-caster\memory\`
On the new machine this will be `c--Users-Jamie-AppData-Local-caster`. After cloning `claude-config-backup`, manually move/rename the memory folder:
```
C:\Users\Jamie\.claude\projects\c--Users-Nate-AppData-Local-caster\memory\
→ rename parent folder to: c--Users-Jamie-AppData-Local-caster
```
[Claude can help] I can do this rename automatically once running on the new machine.

**Stream Deck button paths**
Stream Deck buttons that call `MAINFUN.bat` use relative-style calls (just `MAINFUN.bat FunctionName`) so those should be fine. If any buttons have full absolute paths, they'll need updating. Check after setup.

**App version paths in windows_commands.py**
`BringApp` calls still contain version numbers (e.g. `Discord\app-1.0.9016`). These will likely change on reinstall — update them once apps are installed.
[Claude can help] Run "go discord" and if it fails, update the version number in the path.

**Dragon profile**
Dragon stores the profile in OneDrive, but the profile may contain internal references to `C:\Users\Nate`. If Dragon has issues after restoring the profile, re-run acoustic training or create a new profile.

**Caster settings files**
Check `C:\Users\Jamie\AppData\Local\caster\settings\` for any hardcoded paths after restoring. `settings.toml` and `rules.toml` may reference old paths.
[Claude can help] Search and fix these after the new install.

## Loose Notes

**Eye/head tracking:** Tobii, eViacam, and PrecisionGazeMouse have no backups. Will need to be reconfigured from scratch after install. eViacam and PrecisionGazeMouse settings are not documented anywhere — expect to spend time re-tuning sensitivity and behavior.

**SoundSwitch:** No backup. Will need to be reconfigured after install — note hotkey settings and microphone profiles before wiping.
