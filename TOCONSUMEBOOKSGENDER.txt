TRANSMISOGYNY:
	Hi! As far as video essays go, i rly value lily alexandre's content. I particular enjoy and relate to girls own the void, and found it helpful to articulate my experiences

	A lot of my learning was admittedly done on social media from transfems of color and Black transfems. Particularly bloomfilters (ash/hari), disrupthehuman (g), and Nsámbu Za Suékama (Nsámbu has more long-form content)
