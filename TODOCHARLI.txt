hi Charli, I love you. this is just a cute little mix tape I made for you, I hope you love it, I really enjoyed making it for you. hopefully there will be many more. A few of the songs are directly related to just things we did together, anything, don't talk put your head on my shoulder, and passenger seat really give me that feeling of just cherishing the time we spent together. And some songs like swinging party are kind of about our shared sadness. A few of the songs have mono normative lyrics or themes but just look past that. Anyway, this is for Charli volume 1 mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
