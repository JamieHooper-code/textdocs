Yap about whatever book(s) you’ve been reading over a warm cup of tea 🫖  Even if you haven't been reading lately, come listen and join in on the discussion.

We'll brew a communal tea pot, and you're welcome to bring some tea or anything else if you'd like 💕

Guerrilla Poetry - text 352-215-3505

hi this is Jamie (she/they) I would love to do guerrilla poetry sometime, I write a lot of poetry but I never share it with anyone so I think that would be super great!

this Jamie lol: https://www.instagram.com/jamieee_maybe/

Fall equinox September 22nd at Becca & Sierra’s 239-200-9491

hi this is Jamie (she/they) I would love to attend your fall equinox party! I know we didn't chat much but you both seemed nice :))

this Jamie lol since there were two of us: https://www.instagram.com/jamieee_maybe/





to Cristina:
	sorry this is so late lol and ended up so long >.< Hopefully some of it is useful in some way <3

	For me personally the thing that holds my entire sanity together is meditating/breathing exercises/yoga/corpse pose/child's pose, I know the first three are very difficult and a long-term investment but the last two are actually pretty easy and super beneficial. If you have any questions about any of that let me know it's one of my special interests :P

	Beyond that, laying in bed listening to sad music is a big one for me, or having kind of like intense periods of activation to some very manic music that's like a planned/controlled timeslot like the length of a playlist/album usually gets a lot of my ambient stress all out at once. Going for walks is also big one for me but obviously it's 100 freaking degrees >.<

	Physical touch is also really massive for me, especially like light sensory touch from someone I feel safe with. So like back scratches, head scratches, etc. a good substitute for me is like really hot and/or really cold showers especially back to back.

	And then finally just like shutting off my brain and watching a comfort show or a new show that I'm really invested in usually will reset my entire existence
	
	
To Erin:
	please don't hate me and I'm excited for your party I will probably be there <3

	Dismantling the patriarchy also involves addressing the oppression that men face from other men, and the "Manly" notion that men should not talk about their mental health or should feel shameful about it is an incredibly powerful tool of the patriarchy to keep men oppressed by other men and continually complicit in the continuation of the patriarchy. 
	
	A lot of men's rights stuff is obviously patriarchal and sexist nonsense, but advocacy for men's mental health and for their ability to share their feelings and talk about suicide ideation is exactly what men's mental health advocacy should look like and as feminists we should not belittle that message. and I think that marketing these things specifically toward men is productive because they have been so brainwashed by the patriarchy to view these things as feminine or relating to women that sometimes you have to market it directly toward them for it to even enter their algorithms or their brains.
	
Thank you so much for sending that, I had a couple thoughts on the way a few of the questions were phrased if that's okay. I know you don't love to have political discussions virtually so feel free to ignore this if you want but I do think it's relevant for tomorrow.

I think that it's very important not to presuppose certain concepts when making questions. For example, I find the statement "romance is inherently queerphobic" to be a pretty big claim that I think many participants will not feel is "proved" just by what is contained in the manifesto, so could/should be a topic of discussion/debate. 

so in the question: "a.	How do we square romance being inherently queerphobic..." I think it would be better worded to say something like "how do we square the assertion that romance is inherently queer phobic...." Which I think gives the audience more room to feel allowed to question the premise and discuss.
