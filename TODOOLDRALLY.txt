but basically there is a protest on the 23rd at the career fair. Currently it is only being advertised to trusted people and information won't go out until like the night before to everyone.

There is a meeting to help plan it next Thursday 


Okay so basically there is a protest of/at the career fair on the 23rd at noon, it is not currently public but is shareable in trusted circles. It's at the O'Connell center. the main point is to protest US invitation of and collaboration with weapons manufacturers and war profiteers like L3 Harris and Raytheon.

There is a meeting to help plan it this Thursday the 12th at 630 at the CMC, anyone trusted is invited. but also in general feel free to shout out UF divest if you're willing because they do need new volunteers.

We would love if you mention it to the other leadership assuming they are all trusted, and if any of y'all want we would love to have someone there to represent GAU, we are hoping to have as many representatives of local organizations there as possible on Thursday

It's going to go public around like six or 7 PM on the 22nd so feel free to shout it out in any way at that point if you want to
