I spent the summer filling 
all the cracks that seem to grow
when We’re not looking 
They somehow always know
All the holes you couldn’t help but put
in our tiny peaceful home
-
how I watched you, doing nothing
When you couldn't face yourself
What was it I did to you
To make you treat me like that
Did I deserve you, and do I deserve myself
-
the questions I keep asking
While I spend my summers filling
all those cracks I never knew
Were creeping up behind me
Connecting me just to you
But now I try to hide them
But somehow they still all seem to know
Wet cement and flimsy tape
Are all that seems to go
