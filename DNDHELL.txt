Message from Ven (Denny's Brother), The title is kinda clickbait. This video is mostly a great breakdown of godhood/the deity system in DnD. Explains a lot of good info that I don't think is spoiler-y at all/is only helpful to yall as players, Tuesday, January 9 2024, 7:47 PM.

Message from Ven (Denny's Brother), The last few minutes, when he starts talking about Ao, can be skipped. Ao isn't a direct factor - he is considered by most to just be a stand-in for the DM itself, Tuesday, January 9 2024, 7:50 PM.

Message from Ven (Denny's Brother), Also - y'all will be entering hell via the 5th layer, Stygia. This vid is about Levistus, who runs the 5th layer. The specifics of his backstory aren't super important, but there's a good description of Stygia at the very beginning Rei & Jamie's characters would at least know who Levistus is. Some knowledge in this vid will come in handy since you're traveling through his realm. Devils live for deals and love betraying other devils... knowledge can be a very useful tool for y'all. It is up to each of you as players of course, but it would make sense for most of your characters to study up on the known devil lords since you're going to hell. Learning a little about layers 1-5 could give you huge advantages in conversations and combat!, Tuesday, January 9 2024, 8:17 PM.

Message from Ven (Denny's Brother), You want to get to the 3rd layer, Minauros. Barring your actions changing things, you could exit via the 5th where you entered or the 1st, Tuesday, January 9 2024, 8:23 PM.
