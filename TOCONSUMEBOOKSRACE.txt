	Reflection questions:
	- What feelings of discomfort arise while reading these texts, and what might they reveal?
	- Where do I see “right to comfort” operating in my own circles or communities?
	- Who is allowed to express anger, and who is told to be polite?
	- How might I respond differently when discomfort shows up in anti-oppressive work?
