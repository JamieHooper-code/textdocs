Hello, I'm interested in getting laser on full lower body without feet or pelvic region. And including a small part of the lower back, just about 4 inches above the waistline mostly just in the center. I'm interested in doing the six session deal. Normally that would be 2500 but I am excluding pelvis which is a pretty difficult/substantial region. I was hoping we could do 2000 for the six sessions (I'm pretty broke)? which would come out to 333 per session and I would like to pay per session if possible. is this a possibility?
