1. Gentle physical warm-up (neck, shoulders, jaw)
2. Breath work (diaphragmatic + hissing)
3. Straw phonation or lip trills
4. 10–15 mins vocal warmups (from YouTube playlists)
5. Sing a simple song, focusing on ease and breath

1. Body + Breath Awareness (5 minutes)
	Goal: Release physical tension and establish supported breathing.

	 Shoulder rolls, neck circles, jaw massage.
	 Diaphragmatic breathing:

	   Inhale through nose, expand belly.
	   Exhale slowly on a hiss ("sss") for 8–12 seconds (repeat x3).
	   Voiced exhales: "vvv", "zzz", "mmmm" (focus on facial/lip vibration).

2. Vocal Reset / Recovery (5 minutes)
	Goal: Reset the voice with gentle exercises, especially if there's fatigue.

	 Straw phonation (semi-occluded vocal tract exercise):

	   Hum through a straw into water while doing light sirens (1–2 minutes).
	 Alternatives:

	   Lip trills or "ng" slides (like humming "sing").

3. Technique Warm-Ups (10–15 minutes)
Goal: Build vocal coordination for resonance, breath, and tone.

 Start with:

   Lip trills or "ng" sirens.
 Then:

   5-note scales on "gee", "nay", or "mum".
   Head-chest mixing: "noo" or "nuh" sliding up and down.
 Focus on ease, not power or range.

4. Song Practice (5–10 minutes)
Goal: Apply technique to music without strain.

 Pick a simple, comfortable song (folk, indie, soft ballads).
 Focus on:

   Breathing low.
   Ease over perfection.
   Relaxed jaw and throat.
 If tired: hum or use lip trills on the melody.

---

5. Optional Reflection / Recording (2–5 minutes)
Goal: Track progress and build self-awareness.

 Reflect on:

   What felt easy/difficult?
   Any fatigue or tension?
 Record yourself 1–2x per week for progress tracking.

---

Weekly Variations

 1–2x/week: Swap song time for a vocal technique video.
 Every 2–3 days: Use pitch tracking apps (Vanido, SingSharp).
 1 rest day/week: Just do breath and vocal reset exercises.

Red Flags – If You Experience These, Scale Back:

 Throat tightness, pain.
 Needing to push to be heard.
 Hoarseness or voice loss.

If symptoms persist, return to breath and recovery only, and ask for adjustments.

This plan can be further tailored for genre preferences or transfeminine vocal goals.
