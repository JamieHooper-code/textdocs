Thank you so much for the reply. 

You mentioned that you do not sell goose liver products but according to your appetizer menu you serve Pan Seared Foie Gras. This is the item that we are protesting and is the source of intense suffering for every duck and goose whose liver ends up on the table at your restaurant. I hope that you will do some research on this menu item and realize the suffering that it is causing, independent of any desire not to be protested for selling it.

As part of our campaign to abolish the sale of foie gras in Gainesville we are peacefully protesting against any businesses that continue to sell it. We have already succeeded in our campaign against two restaurants in Gainesville. One after a brief email exchange, and the other after a lengthy campaign. 

I understand and appreciate the time and effort it can take to change the menu, but unless we receive confirmation that you are willing to implement a foie gras free policy we will have no choice but to begin our campaign. We are in complete agreement about safety and security, our campaign is centered around peaceful protest.

I would love to meet up in person or organize a phone call to discuss this further.

Thank you so much,
Gainesville Animal Defenders
