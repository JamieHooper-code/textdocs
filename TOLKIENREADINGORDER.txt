The hobbit
The Lord of the rings
The Silmarillion

The children of Hurin
Unfinished Tales

Baron and Lucien ( as part of history three )
Gondolin ( as part of history two )

If you're still hungry after all this, you can dive into History of Middle Earth - Morgoth's Ring (vol X) is the most interesting one for most fans, as it covers general metaphysics and background, i.e. hardcore lore, rather than abandoned/progressive drafts.
