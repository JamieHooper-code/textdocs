Gathas are nourishment for your mind and body, giving you peace, calm, and joy, which you can share with others. They help you to bring the uninterrupted practice of meditation into every part of your day. You can start with the gathas here, find more in the book Present Moment Wonderful Moment, or you can write your own. Writing your own gathas is a longstanding Zen tradition, one that I inherited from my teacher and pass on to my students.

SPANISH:
	Intentions:
		Después de la ducha, 
		me siento a meditar 
		y respirar con calma. 

		Al despertar, 
		mi intención es empezar el día 
		con gratitud y presencia. 

		Antes de beber mi té, 
		me propongo saborearlo 
		y estar consciente 
		de cada sorbo. 

		Hoy me comprometo 
		a escuchar mi cuerpo 
		y atender sus necesidades 
		con paciencia.

		Mientras camino 
		o me siento, 
		me concentro en mantener 
		una postura abierta 
		y relajada. 

	Gathas:
		
		Al abrir los ojos, 
		saludo el día con calma. 

		Cada sorbo de té 
		me recuerda estar presente. 

		Siento mi cuerpo, 
		y le doy espacio 
		para descansar y moverse. 

		Mi columna está erguida, 
		mi mente está clara. (My spine is upright, my mind is clear.)

		Inhalo paz, 
		exhalo tensión.

Waking Up:
	Waking up this morning, I smile.
	Twenty-four brand new hours are before me.
	I vow to live fully each moment
	and to look at beings with the eye of compassion
 
TEA:
	Drinking Tea
	This cup of tea in my two hands,
	mindfulness held perfectly.
	My mind and body dwell,
	in the very here and now.



BELLS:
	Letting Go
	Hearing the bell,
	I am able to let go of all afflictions.
	My heart is calm, my sorrows ended.
	I am no longer bound to anything.
	I learn to listen to my suffering and the suffering of the other person.
	When understanding is born in me, compassion is also born.

	Body, Speech, and mind in perfect oneness, 
	I Send my heart along with the Sound of this bell. 
	May the hearers awaken from forgetfulness 
	and transcend the path of anxiety and Sorrow.
	
	Listen, listen. 
	This wonderful Sound 
	brings me back 
	to my true home.

SITTING OR WALKING:
	I have arrived. I am home.
	In the here, in the now.
	I am Solid. I am free.
	In the ultimate, I dwell.
	
TAKING REFUGE:
	Breathing in, I go back to the island within myself.
	There are beautiful trees within the island.
	There are cool streams of water, 
	there are birds, sunshine, and fresh air.
	Breathing out, I feel safe

LISTENING TO MY BODY/CHRONIC PAIN:
	I am aware that this is only a physical wound. It will heal.
	I will rest mindfully and soothe my panicked and worried mind.
	

	I am being mindful of and listening to my body
	it is sending me important signals I should not ignore
	this task I am doing is not nearly as important as my health and safety
	I learn to return to the body and listen patiently
	-
	the task will still be there in the future
	and I can revisit slowly and steadily and respectfully
	though it may seem to be the most important thing in this moment
	that feeling will fade but my body will remain

BEING IN TUNE WITH SURROUNDINGS:
	Aware of my ears, I breathe in.
	Aware of the sound of rain, I breathe out.
	
	In touch with pure __ air, I breathe in.
	Smiling with pure __ air, I breathe out.
	
	In touch with the sunshine, I breathe in.
	Smiling with the sunshine, I breath out.
	
	In touch with the trees, I breathe in.
	Smiling with the trees, I breathe out.






ANSWERING THE PHONE:
	Words can travel thousands of miles. 
	May my words create mutual understanding and love. 
	May they be as beautiful as gems, 
	as lovely as flowers.


ANGER:
	Smiling at Your Anger
	Breathing in, I know anger makes me sick,
	Breathing out, I do not want to be controlled by anger.
	Breathing in, I know I must take care of myself,
	Breathing out, I know loving kindness is the only answer.

Washing Your Hands
	Water flows over these hands.
	May I use them skillfully
	to preserve our precious planet.

Brushing Your Teeth
	Brushing my teeth and rinsing my mouth,
	I vow to speak purely and lovingly.
	When my mouth is fragrant with right speech,
	a flower blooms in the garden of my heart.

Driving the Car
	Before starting the car
	I know where I am going.
	The car and I are one.
	If the car goes fast, I go fast.

Watering the Plants
	Don't think that you are cut off, dear plant.
	This water comes to you from the Earth and sky
	You and I have been together
	since beginningless time.
