Gathas are nourishment for your mind and body, giving you peace, calm, and joy, which you can share with others. They help you to bring the uninterrupted practice of meditation into every part of your day. You can start with the gathas here, find more in the book Present Moment Wonderful Moment, or you can write your own. Writing your own gathas is a longstanding Zen tradition, one that I inherited from my teacher and pass on to my students.


ANXIETY:
	ANTICIPATORY ANXIETY HELPERS:
		UNCTERTAINTY CONTAINMENT:
			I don’t have the information yet, and I won’t until I arrive.
			This can’t be solved in advance.
			There’s nothing to decide right now.
			Uncertainty is expected here.
			I’ll know what to do once I have real data.

		SIMULATION SHUTDOWN:
			This is a simulation, not a decision.
			I don’t need to answer this thought.
			This is forecast mode, not reality.
			I’m not required to solve imaginary problems.
			I can stop thinking about this now.

		TIME BOUNDARY / DEFERRAL:
			This belongs to future-me.
			I’ll deal with this at the moment it happens.
			Now is not the time for this.
			I don’t need to pre-live this.
			Later has permission to exist.

		SOCIAL PRESSURE DEFLATION:
			This does not require a perfect outcome.
			People are not tracking this as closely as I am.
			It’s okay to be unoptimized.
			Nothing bad happens if this is a little awkward.
			I’m allowed to take up space imperfectly.

		NERVOUS SYSTEM REORIENTATION:
			This feeling is anticipation, not danger.
			My body is activated, not threatened.
			I can carry this feeling without fixing it.
			This sensation will change on its own.
			I don’t need to make this stop.
	EVENING:
		TRANSITIONING INTO EVENING HELPERS:
			TRANSITION / LIMBO ORIENTATION

				I can let the day close.
				Nothing needs to be optimized right now.

			EVENING MODE PERMISSION
				Evening mode starts now.
				Rest does not require justification.
				I’m allowed to move slowly here.

			NERVOUS SYSTEM SETTLING
				This feeling will settle once the transition completes.

		ANTICIPATORY ANXIETY ABOUT EVENINGS:
			EVENING UNCERTAINTY CONTAINMENT
				I don’t need to know how the evening will feel yet.
				The evening already has a container.
				I’m not required to make this a good night.
				This time will pass whether or not it’s optimized.

			LONELINESS ANTICIPATION
				Feeling lonely later is allowed.
				Loneliness is a feeling, not a failure.
				I can be alone without being abandoned.
				I have options if this feeling shows up.

			AIMLESSNESS PERMISSION
				It’s okay if nothing sounds appealing.
				I don’t need a perfect activity.
				Familiar and neutral are enough.
				Doing nothing is still doing something.

			FALLBACK AUTHORIZATION
				If I feel stuck, I’ll choose the easiest option.
				If I feel restless, I’ll do something with my hands.
				If I feel heavy, I’ll lie down and rest.

			GROUNDING CUES
				Feel your feet on the floor.
				Notice one warm sensation.
				Breathe out longer than you breathe in.
	TRAVELING:
		TRAVEL LIMBO / ANTICIPATORY GRIEF
			I'm sad about leaving my home and my people.
			I don’t need to feel excited yet.
			I’m sad about leaving home, and that’s allowed.
			This is grief, not danger.
			Nothing after departure is real yet, and that’s okay.
			I can feel both anticipation and sadness at the same time.

		CONTINUITY / ANCHORING
			I carry home with me through [object/ritual].
			Connection to home doesn’t require being there.
			I am still me, even in a new place.
			Familiar cues help me stay grounded.

		FUTURE CONTROL / REALITY CHECK
			I don’t need to predict how I’ll feel.
			Reality resumes on arrival.
			I won’t solve the whole trip in advance.
			I can respond, not pre-live.
			The gap between here and there is temporary and survivable.

		EMOTIONAL PERMISSION
			Feeling lonely or missing things is allowed.
			Excitement can come later, naturally.
			I don’t need to manufacture fun or meaning yet.
			All feelings in this limbo are valid.

	PAIN ANTICIPATORY ANXIETY:
		MINDFULNESS MANTRAS:
			ANTICIPATORY PAIN ORIENTATION
				This pain can be a prediction, not new damage.
				My nervous system is trying to protect me.
				Anticipation can amplify sensation.
				I don’t need to eliminate this feeling to be safe.
				I can notice pain without escalating it.

			STOP vs SAFE-BUT-SENSITIVE
				Sharp, worsening, or destabilizing pain means stop.
				Steady, familiar, or background pain can be sensitive but safe.
				I’m allowed to check in and change course.
				Pain does not have to reach zero to be okay.
				I can pause without failing.

			SAFETY PLANNING
				I have exits and options.
				I can stop or modify at any time.
				I don’t need to finish or push through.
				I know how to care for myself if this flares.
				I won’t abandon myself if pain increases.

			DECENTERING THE THREAT
				Pain is information, not a verdict.
				This sensation can rise and fall.
				Not every signal requires action.
				I can let my body settle before deciding.
				I don’t need to predict the entire outcome.

			EMOTIONAL PERMISSION
				It’s okay to grieve what pain limits.
				Pleasure and pain can coexist.
				I’m allowed to want things even if they hurt sometimes.
				My worth is not measured by endurance.

		
		ANTICIPATORY PAIN PROCEDURE
			1. Name the state
			   This is anticipatory or predictive pain.
			   I am not required to fix it.

			2. Reduce threat signals
			   Unclench hands, jaw, shoulders.
			   Let arms rest heavy.
			   Slow exhale.

			3. Check pain type
			   Sharp or escalating → stop.
			   Familiar, steady, background → sensitive but possibly safe.

			4. Declare safety options
			   I can stop, pause, or change position.
			   I do not need to finish.

			5. Lower the time horizon
			   I only need to decide for the next few minutes.
			   I am not planning the whole activity.

			6. Choose the least demanding option
			   Modify instead of push.
			   Comfort over performance.

			7. Reassess gently
			   Notice whether sensation settles, stays, or worsens.
			   Adjust without judgment.

			8. Exit if needed
			   Stopping early is a valid outcome.
			   Self-protection is success.

	Twenty-four brand new hours are before me.
	I vow to live fully each moment
	and to look at beings with the eye of compassion
 
TEA:
	Drinking Tea
	This cup of tea in my two hands,
	mindfulness held perfectly.
	My mind and body dwell,
	in the very here and now.



BELLS:
	Letting Go
	Hearing the bell,
	I am able to let go of all afflictions.
	My heart is calm, my sorrows ended.
	I am no longer bound to anything.
	I learn to listen to my suffering and the suffering of the other person.
	When understanding is born in me, compassion is also born.

	Body, Speech, and mind in perfect oneness, 
	I Send my heart along with the Sound of this bell. 
	May the hearers awaken from forgetfulness 
	and transcend the path of anxiety and Sorrow.
	
	Listen, listen.

LISTENING TO MY BODY/CHRONIC PAIN:
	I am aware that this is only a physical wound. It will heal.
	I will rest mindfully and soothe my panicked and worried mind.
	

	I am being mindful of and listening to my body
	it is sending me important signals I should not ignore
	this task I am doing is not nearly as important as my health and safety
	I learn to return to the body and listen patiently
	-
	the task will still be there in the future
	and I can revisit slowly and steadily and respectfully
	though it may seem to be the most important thing in this moment
	that feeling will fade but my body will remain

ANSWERING THE PHONE:
	Words can travel thousands of miles. 
	May my words create mutual understanding and love. 
	May they be as beautiful as gems, 
	as lovely as flowers.


ANGER:
	Smiling at Your Anger
	Breathing in, I know anger makes me sick,
