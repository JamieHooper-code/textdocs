I am currently waiting on my referral to go through from Dr. Gupta. If she's referring me to someone that used to be a part of SciMed health but is no longer. I want her to also send a referral to accent physician specialists.

I am interested in being seen by Dr. Jeelani, at accent physician specialists. I called them and they said that I need a letter from a physician, I asked if that policy was outdated based on the law changing in August, they were not sure and bumped me around until I got a voicemail. I am waiting on their callback but also I want to call them again and get names of people.

I have had ongoing struggles gender dysphoria for several years and I am very interested in doing a consultation to find a therapist that specializes in this as well as discussing the possibility of hormone replacement therapy.


I live in Florida and  need a doctor to sign that consent form thing

I am looking for a medical doctor in Gainesville that can sign the Florida consent form thing in person. I would love some recommendations, I'm not going to start my subscription until I get that because who knows how long that will take. I have contacted Planned Parenthood  and the UF health and neither are taking on new clients.

Gender Affirming Hormone Therapy With Dr. Jeelani.

Hello my name is Jamie Hooper (legal name Nathanael Hooper) and I am interested in gender affirming hormone therapy with Doctor Jeelani.

I was just seen by my PCP who will be sending y'all a referral at some point. I gave y'all a call and I was told that I need a letter from a psychiatrist or psychologist. I have a letter but it is from my therapist who is a licensed clinical social worker. 

I was wondering if your policy is outdated because the law requiring a letter from a psychiatrist or psychologist specifically was changed back in August, and I was wondering if my letter from my therapist would be acceptable. Currently under the law no letter is required.

Thank you so much, 
Jamie
