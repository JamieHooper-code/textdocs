There's no need to apologize for being ignorant on a topic like this, the issue is when you are ignorant and then say certain things with a certain level of confidence or assertion that don't line up with your current knowledge on the topic.

Sometimes when you're asking me questions it can feel leading or pointed rather than curious especially when my stance on something does not really conform to your worldview or expectations. I understand that you're my mother and you're worried about me but I'm also an adult and very intelligent and a pretty slow rational decision-maker capable of making my own informed decisions.

One of the conversations I'm referring to which I realize was like three years ago (wow almost to the day) I think it was February 6, 2021 I told you that I was non-binary and was really struggling with it. this was the first time you had ever been presented with anything like this and you told me that I shouldn't ever do hormones or have surgery. I realize this was three years ago and you've learned a lot since then but that really stuck with me. 

The fact that you had no base of knowledge on this topic at all and yet were trying to instruct me on what to do was really upsetting. We haven't even discussed it at that point in the conversation and it wasn't really something I was even remotely close to considering starting and yet you dove in with advice less than two hours after learning about the whole situation.I understand that your position in the situations is very difficult and you want what's best for me and I do appreciate that but it doesn't always come through the best way.

We had a lot of similarly upsetting conversations about me changing my name. You want to maintain the status quo and for me to be societally normative and it feels like a lot of your questions are attempting to maintain that rather than attempting to help me understand myself and be myself.I am almost 30 and sometimes when I talk about these things you give me advice like I'm 15. 

I love you and I appreciate your efforts to help me and talk to me and I know that you're trying your best.
